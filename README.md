# Weather-App
A MVVM iOS weather based app where users can look up weather for a city in USA.



We are going to build this app, with
– UIKit with MVVM architecture
– XIB based reusable views
– Coordinators for navigation
– Moya for networking
– RxSwift for reactive implementation
We will also be sprinkling some Singletons, Delegates, protocols and a couple of test cases. All of these are pretty basic, but when combined together can be used to build pretty scalable applications.
